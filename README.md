Stay Awake
-------
Keep your machine awake and unlocked by making a mouse move at regular interval. Start it when you are not actively using 
your machine.

Stay Awake is:
* Platform independent - Works on OS X, Windows and Linux
* Ultra light - total distribution size around 10 kb
* Self contained - No library dependencies

### Installation

- Make sure we have JRE on machine
- [Download](https://github.com/kdabir/stay-awake/releases) the application distribution archive and extract it
- (optional) Add the `{extracted_archives_path}/bin` to `PATH` env variable 


### Usage
* Run the bat (on Windows) or shell file (on OS X / Linux)
    - by double clicking the file
    - or if we have it on `PATH`, just call the script `stay-awake`
    
* We can optionally pass a number representing interval in seconds. Mouse moves at this interval. Recommended value is between 15 - 90. 

* To stop, press `control+c` 


### Developer Notes

We should have `gradle` locally Change the requires files and then from the project root:

- Simplest way is to run with Gradle `run`
    
    `$ gradle run`

- To run with generated OS specific scripts:
    1. run  
      `gradle clean dZ && cd build/distributions && unzip -o stay-awake.zip && cd -`
  
    2. and then   
      `./build/distributions/stay-awake/bin/stay-awake 10`

- We can run/debug the Main class with IntelliJ Idea or any IDE of our choice as well.
